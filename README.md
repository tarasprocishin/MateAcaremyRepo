# **Hi!**

### It is my homework by **0** lesson, the **goal** of the work is:

  * study the basics of working with **git**;
  
  * make own github page;
  
  * github markdown study.
  
  To study the basics I used the [recommended materials](https://githowto.com/).  After I created a new repository, named it according to the [template](https://pages.github.com/) that is needed to create the github page, and then push the test task by Frontend.
  
  For design README.md I use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links).
